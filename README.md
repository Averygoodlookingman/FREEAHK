1. You need ahk from autohotkey.com to get this running.
2. I made this script because Nom's new script only allows 2 color boxes, with two click locations each. His old script allowed 3 color boxes, with unlimited click locations. Which was perfect for clicking pray icon, mage/range/melee prayer, and back into invy.
3. This edited version of his old script allows 4 or 8 color boxes with unlimited clicks, based on which one you download.
4. How to use: Double click script
5. Hold control and click either 1/2/3/4/q/w/e/r to add points to click within a color coded box, you can add multiple box locations. If you want your qwer keys free to still type in game, download the 4 version instead of 8.
6. Once boxes are added, click the corresponding key to the box 1/2/3/4/q/w/e/r to auto click every colored box in order. Hold key to spam click every box.
7. To delete boxes, Hold Alt and click either 1/2/3/4/q/w/e/r to delete.
8. To exit click F6.
9. To toggle color boxes display, click F5.
10. Great for swapping prayers/gear.
11. Can also use it to fletch darts incredibly fast, or save a few clicks when fletching/potion making etc.
12. I'm not a coder, no plans to make further adjustments.
